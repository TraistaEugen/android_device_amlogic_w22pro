###About the Framework
It is highly recommended to use [https://github.com/librehat/android_frameworks_base]（[https://github.com/librehat/android_frameworks_base]，this version）, because some modifications need to be applied to make the device play around properly with CyanogenMod.

Also, thank Christiantroy for his excellent work for Ainol Elf II!

###Requirement
Android ICS building environment.
Also, it is recommended to use GCC 4.4 rather than 4.7 or even higher version.
