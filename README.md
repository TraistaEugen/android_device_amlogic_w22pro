This is an unofficial code converted from https://github.com/christiantroy/android_device_ainol_elf2
It is possible that some functions are disabled due to lacking of proper configurations or right codes.

###About the Framework
It is highly recommended to use this version: https://github.com/librehat/android_frameworks_base , because some modifications need to be applied to make the device play around properly with CyanogenMod.

Also, thank Christiantroy for his excellent work for Ainol Elf II!

###Requirement
Android ICS building environment.
Also, it is recommended to use GCC 4.4 rather than 4.7 or even higher version.
