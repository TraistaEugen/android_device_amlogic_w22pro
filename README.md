###Some AML-specific repos
It is highly recommended to use the branches which named jellybean-aml in my repo that I forked and changed, because some modifications need to be applied to make the device play around properly with CyanogenMod.
In addition to that, you need to use other jellybean-aml branches from [Christiantroy's repo](https://github.com/christiantroy).

**The Priority Sequence**
My repo > Christiantroy's > Original CyanogenMod

Thank Christiantroy for his excellent work for Ainol Elf II!

###Requirement
Android Jellybean building environment.
Also, it is recommended to use GCC 4.4.x (4.6.x may be okay, too) rather than 4.7.x or even higher version.
